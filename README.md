# Background
With the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong and around the world, international travel becomes nearly impossible because of the travel restrictions imposed. Citizens are eager to go outside, yet, given the staggering numbers, they are having second thoughts. This raises the question: is there a safe way to still go on adventures and explore Hong Kong right now? Introducing our innovation - EXPLORE4U.

# EXPLORE4U
EXPLORE4U is a mobile app which aims at helping users explore the local community in a personalized and safe manner, as a hackathon idea in the travel track for Hack Viral 2020.

Here is a demonstration of mapping covid-19 cases and local travel attractions in Hong Kong using [Google Maps Javascript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overview) and [Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/overview)

The red marker indicates a COVID-19 case while the others represent a local exotic attraction. Heart symbol means a location recommended for couples, the lattern means a local tradition, to name but a few.

We present to you an opportunity to share your stories and special experiences so others can share the same feeling. Explore local culture, food, and traditions through our interactive map and regular video inputs/updates from our users. 

Stay safe. Stay Active. Stay Adventurous.
